# Internal release of c++ boost library

## Background
  Boost was released through 3 channels:
  1. bintray, which will be deprecated soon.
  2. sourceforge, which has a rate limit.
  3. github, which is only done per module and doesn't have an all-in-one release.

## Usage
  We created this repo to replicate the all-in-one release as a direct replacement of our current dependencies using bintray.
